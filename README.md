Sony Sign In App
================

This app was built for a friend of a friend, who works as a receptionist at Sony. Using this app, people can sign in at her desk, inputting their name, which company they're from, and who they're looking for. The app appends the current time upon sign in, and users can go to the app afterwards to checkout. Similar to sign in, the current time is appended by the app upon checkout to the corresponding record. The admin of the app can view the current data, delete all current data, or email all of the current data as a .csv.

Potential Extra Functionality:

1. Password for admin functionality
2. 
2. None terrible looking graphical interface
3. 
3. Data selection upon emailing the .csv
4. 
4. Record deletion
